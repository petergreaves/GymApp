# GymApp

This application is a personal learning project to assist in my Spring Framework 5 development.   The application is a web application supporting a Gym,
and will illustrate the core features that are needed to demonstrate competence and understanding of the Spring framework.

Even though this is a personal learning gig, I'll be aiming to produce a good quality, secure working web application in a multi-module project, well supported by tests and using CircleCI for builds.   Rate of development will vary, but things will move.
